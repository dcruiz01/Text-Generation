# Text Generation
This repository explores the generation of text that adopts vocabulary, grammar, and stylistic components from a given corpus.

The rnn_char.ipynb notebook provides a proof of concept showing a character-level recurrent neural network generating text in the style of a specified twitter user with acceptable performance given minimal training.

Ongoing work demonstrates the application of transformers to this problem, with future work providing a toolset for automatic fake tweet generation after providing a twitter UserID.
